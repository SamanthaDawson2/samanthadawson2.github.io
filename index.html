      <p class="aboutparagraph"> Hi I'm Samantha and I work at Sage Recruiting in Toronto, Canada. I have been a technical recruiter for over 1+ year and I specialize in recruiting software developers for SMB's and Start-Ups. On my spare time, I love to check out new resturants, go hiking, visit family, travel, hang out with my two cats and of course, learn how to code! Check out my code on my GitHub "SamanthaDawson2" and if you have any feed back I would love to hear it!  </p>

      <h2> Recruitment Done Right </h2>
      <p>Sage Recruiting was founded on the notion that recruitment can be done better. We are a team of highly technical recruiters who are passionate about helping clients and candidates achieve their goals, and the innovations created from emerging technologies. We take a very different approach to recruitment; we focus communication directly on the candidate allowing us to reach ‘the unreachable’, and listen closely to the wants and needs of our clients in order to achieve optimal results, every time. </p>

      <p> I took a trip to California on Family Day weekend and boy was it fun! My flight was delayed 4+ hours because of a torrential downpour but other than that it was a perfect weekend! We walked along Venice Beach to Santa Monica Pier, hiked through the Hollywood Hills, checked out West Hollywood and ate a ton of food! I would recommend checking out Sugerfish in Santa Monica and Kings Road Cafe on Beverly Blvd.  </p>

       <p> March 2017: Women in Technology </p> <p> Sage in Tech and Ecentricarts hosted an event to celebrate and discuss how far women in the technology field have come on March 8th. There were five speakers rangings from COO, Founders, CEO, Principle Engineers and Research Scientiest who took the floor and discussed issues women in tech have over come and issues we are still working on. It was an empowering event to be at! Sage will be hosting more meetups in the future, and we would love to see you all there. I will keep you posted on our next meet up! </p>

         <p> April 2017: Baking Easter Cakes </p>  <p> This Easter I decided to make a couple cakes for my family. Everyone was shocked when I showed up with them (haha)! The photo on the left is a layered confetti cake and the one on the right is a layered chocolate cake! Advise to anyone wanting to make these, even though the kitkats look good... they were "too much" and got wasted, I dont think I would use them again. But overall, it was a successful baking adventure and only took me 5ish hours to complete the two!   </p>
